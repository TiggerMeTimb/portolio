//For this class, I will basically just add any variable that I want to call in order to change the websites 
//functionallity and pages. This will not be react states. React states will be used within respective pages
class Variables{
  //currently I want 2 things in here
  // 1) a variable for change
  // 2) a function that takes an integer and updates the value for change to that integer
  // basically change is super inportant as change is going to determain what page we enter
  public var change = 0;
